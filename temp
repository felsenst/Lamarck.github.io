    This is a minor bug fix release.  The bug fixed is:
    <ul>
    <li> FIXED:  lam_conv file converter reversed source and
         destination populations when using custom migration
         matrices.  If you used a custom matrix to set asymmetrical
         migration rates in any prior version, you will need to
         re-convert your files and re-run your analysis.  All
         other results are unaffected.
