<P>
COALESCE fits the model which has a single population of constant size,
and estimates <EM>4Nu</EM>, where <EM>N</EM> is the effective population size and  <EM>u</EM>  is the
neutral mutation rate per site.   If you have a PowerMac, you will want to
fetch the PowerMac binary.  You may also want the Postscript or the TeX file of the
preprint version of the Kuhner, Yamato, and Felsenstein 1995 paper.

<P> Please note:  we are no longer supporting COALESCE as its functions can
be done just as well by <A HREF="../lamarc.html">LAMARC</a> and it's easier for
us to support just one program.  You may still want the paper, however.

<P>
Version 1.5 beta, September 7, 1995
