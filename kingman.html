Sir John Kingman, FRS, is currently the head of the Isaac Newton Institute
of Mathematical Sciences, at Cambridge University, England.   He is the
N.M. Rothschild and Sons Professor of Mathematical Sciences.  He is also
the Chairman of the Statistics Commission, which oversees the quality of
official statistics in the United Kingdom.  He was
until recently Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bristol.
He has also been head of the Science and Engineering Research Council
(SERC).  He was formerly Professor of Mathematics at the University of
Oxford.  He has published five books and about 100 papers, and is widely
known for his work on probability and stochastic processes.  He has
had a long-term side interest in population genetics.
In 1982, he published three papers which laid the
foundation for modern work on coalescent trees of genes:
