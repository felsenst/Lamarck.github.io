<P> 
Mary Kuhner and Jon Yamato work in population and evolutionary genetics
at the University of Washington, Seattle.  We are co-authors of the
program package <A HREF="../lamarc.html">LAMARC</A> which contains
programs to estimate parameters such as population size, mutation rate, 
growth rate, and recombination rate from molecular samples taken from a 
population.
<P>
Until the University clarifies its policy on faculty web pages, you
will have to look elsewhere for information on our non-academic
interests and activities.
