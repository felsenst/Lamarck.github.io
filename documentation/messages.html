    <h2>Error and warning messages in LAMARC</h2>
    <P> Almost everything LAMARC might tell you unexpectedly should be listed below, alphabetically, along with a further explanation of what might have happened to cause the message to be displayed.  Many are error messages, some are only warnings, and a few are just there to let you know what's going on.  Messages with a plus in the 'XML Errors' column can be produced when reading in a LAMARC input file.  Messages with a plus in the 'Menu' column can be produced when working in the menu before LAMARC starts.  Messages with a plus in the remaining three columns are all produced after the menu phase of a LAMARC run:  'Urgent' messages are always displayed because they're very important for you to know; 'Normal' messages are somewhat important or at least interesting; 'Informal' messages are not critical at all, and are there only to let you know what LAMARC is currently doing.

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>After collecting possible trees, LAMARC searches for the set of parameters that will result in the highest likelihood for that set of trees.  Occasionally, this search simply fails.  There are a variety of potential reasons for this failure, and the particular message will give you a clue about why, but in general, it means LAMARC isn't doing its job and finding the best set of parameters for your data.  The particular message is of less importance than where in the run you get this message; see the 'Warning:  maximization failure for this chain' explanation.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>Overflow errors are more serious than underflow errors, since what should be a ridiculously large number is replaced by a merely monstrosly large number.  A few probably won't hurt, but you may want to check your assumptions to see if you can eliminate these types of errors.  This message is only reported once, but a tally is kept and reported in your output file.  Check that to make sure there weren't too many of them.  EXCEPTION:  When calculating theta over regions using gamma-distributed relative mutation rates, overflow is common.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>Warning from the maximizer:  [text]</TD>
			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>After collecting possible trees, LAMARC searches for the set of parameters that will result in the highest likelihood for that set of trees.  This search petered out for some reason; probably because it was taking too long.  There are a variety of potential reasons for this failure, and the particular message will give you a clue about why, but in general, it means LAMARC didn't find the absolute best set of parameters for your data.  The least worrying message to get here is the one that says &ldquo;Warning:  Convergence to the maximum cannot be guaranteed.  Maximization terminated after [number] iterations.  (|gradient| = [number]&rdquo;.  This means that the maximizer thought it could find a better set of parameters if it searched forever, but gave up because it was taking too long.  If the gradient value is low (say, 1 or less), you're almost certainly fine; if it is greater it is somewhat curious, but not too alarming in and of itself.  It's of more importance where in the run you get this message; see the 'Warning:  maximization failure for this chain' explanation.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>Warning:  A newly-calculated value for force &quot;[force]&quot; ([value]) is different from that read in from the summary file [value] (A difference of [value] which exceeds the recommended minimum difference of 0.1%).</TD>
			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>The values from the summary file are different from the values from the current maximization.  This can be due to running a different version of LAMARC, running LAMARC on different computers, or precision issues from reading/writing a decimal number but storing it as hex.  In general, it's something to keep in mind--you may want to re-run LAMARC with longer run-times if it's serious.</TD>

                        <TD ALIGN=LEFT>Warning: calculating FST estimates
                        for [parameter name(s)]is impossible due to the data
                        for the populations involved.  If the FST method is
                        invoked to obtain starting values for those
                        parameters, defaults will be used instead.</TD>

                        <TD ALIGN=LEFT>LAMARC failed to calculate FST values
                        from your data.  This might be because FST is
                        actually impossible to calculate for your data set
                        (this happens if the variability within a population
                        is greater than the variabiltiy between
                        populations), or it might be because LAMARC simply
                        failed to perform the calculation properly.  In
                        either event, this will only affect the starting
                        values for these parameters, and then only if you
                        explicitly tell LAMARC that you want to use FST to
                        give it starting values.  If you do, LAMARC will use
                        defaults instead.  The defaults will almost
                        certainly work fine; we just don't want you to later
                        report "we used FST values as our starting
                        parameters" when in actual fact LAMARC used
                        defaults.  But the general LAMARC algorithms do not
                        use FST in any way, shape, or form, and are
                        therefore immune to irregularities in FST
                        calculation.</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>Warning:  maximization failure for this chain.  Using the parameter estimates from the previous chain and continuing.</TD>
			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>LAMARC failed to figure out what the trees produced from this chain mean.  This could be because the chain was too short--if this happens a lot, try increasing the length.  The upshot of this situation is that while the final tree is probably better than the initial tree, the estimated parameters are no better.  Since LAMARC is designed to estimate parameters, not make trees (per se), this can be bad if it happens a lot, especially if it happens at a later chain (and is particularly bad if it happens at the last chain--it means the entire chain was wasted, and that profiling is impossible.)</TD>

			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>Warning:  the maximizer was unable to find the same maximum likelihood estimates as before for region &quot;[name]&quot;.  The parameter values it found have a log likelihood of [value], which is significantly different from the maximum likelihood of the old set of parameters, [value] (A difference of [value]).  If you were running from older summary files with replication, this is to be expected.  Otherwise, we recommend you re-run this data set with any or all of a) longer run times, b) more replicates, or c) more heating (adaptive or fixed).</TD>
			<TD ALIGN=LEFT>You can get this message if running LAMARC from a summary file when the attempted re-maximization of the final chain produces a different answer than it did the first time.  Newer versions of LAMARC have a more robust maximizer, so if an older version created the summary file, you should be OK.  In addition, if you extended an old summary file with a newer version of LAMARC, the old values will persist in the summary file (though they will be correct in the output file).  The newer version will almost certainly be more accurate.  Running the same version of LAMARC on different computers can also produce differences due to differences in (say) overflow and underflow.  However, if the computer and LAMARC version that produced the summary file are the same as the computer and LAMARC version that gave you this message, something is odd.  You may wish to contact the LAMARC team (lamarc@u.washington.edu) or you could simply re-run your experiment with a different search scheme.</TD>
