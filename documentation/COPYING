Code, documentation, libraries, and executables included with this

Without the availablilty of other open source projects to draw
upon, producing Lamarc would be much less satisfying and much
more difficult. We are greatful to the authors of the software
projects we have used. Their licenses, and ours are available in
the subdirectory ./doc/licenses as summarized below.
