<H2>Compiling LAMARC</H2>

<P> We provide executables of LAMARC for many systems, but if you cannot use
these, or wish to compile the program yourself, we provide source code as well.
This article discusses our experience compiling LAMARC.  We welcome
your comments on the use of other compilers and computing environments.</P>

<P> LAMARC is written in C++.  We tried to avoid advanced or new features of
the language, but very old compilers will probably not work.  We
recommend the use of GNU g++ on any machine which supports it; this is 
the compiler we used to develop LAMARC, and it works well on most systems.</P>

<h3>Compilation and Testing of Released Executables</h3>

<P> Here is a list of machine/compiler combinations we have tried, with
comments on our success or lack of it.</P>

<h3><a name="basic">Basic Instructions for Compiling and Installing LAMARC on *-nix Systems</a></h3>

<p>
Here are basic instructions for compiling on Linux/Unix/Mac OSX
systems.
</p>


<p>
Begin by un-taring the distribution and creating a sub-directory
to compile in. This will keep your object files 
from cluttering up a listing of the top level of the distribution.

    <pre>
    tar xfvz lamarc-2.1.9-src.tar.gz
    cd lamarc-2.1.9
    mkdir release
    cd release
    </pre>
</p>


<p>
The configure script queries your system and produces a
Makefile tailored to your computing environment. Try invoking it
like this:
    <pre>
    ../configure
    </pre>
or, if that doesn't work, like this:
    <pre>
    sh ../configure
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
The configure script will probably complain that you don't have 
<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> installed.
(wxWidgets is a free, open source toolkit for GUI applications.
Through it, we provide native look-and-feel Linux, Mac OS X, and 
Windows GUI interfaces to our file converter using a single code
base.)
If you already have wxWidgets, you can invoke <tt>configure</tt> like this:

    <pre>
    sh ../configure --with-wx-config=/path/to/wx-config
    </pre>

If you don't have wxWidgets, or your current version is too old,
the following invocation should build
a wxWidgets distribution for you. (Be warned that this may take
some time.)
    <pre>
    ../configure --enable-buildwx
    </pre>
</p>

<p>If none of these variations for invoking the configure
script worked for you, skip ahead to
<a href="#advanced">Advanced Configuration Options</a>.
</p>

<p>
You are now ready to make lamarc. (It is recommended that you use
the GNU make utility.  On some systems it may be called gmake.)

    <pre>
    make
    </pre>

This will produce executables lamarc and lam_conv if you're running
on a Unix or Linux system. If you're running under Mac OS X, you
should get clickable executables.
</p>

<p>
To install the executables and html documentation (you may
need sysadmin privilidges to do this, and it is not required
to use the program) type either

    <pre>
    make install
    </pre>

or

    <pre>
    make install-strip
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
Either of these should install the executables in /usr/local/bin and
the documentation under /usr/local/html/lamarc. Executables installed
either way have the same compute time performance. The install-strip
versions are smaller but provide no debugging information, should
you run into problems.
</p>



<h3><a name="advanced">Advanced Configuration Options</a></h3>

<p>
For most users,
the configure script provided with the distribution should work
as <a href="#basic">described above</a>. 
However, there are several situations in which you may wish
to change the behavior of the configure script. These include
when:
<ul>
<li>the configure declares it <a href="#ostype">cannot proceed without 
LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE</a>,</li>
<li>the configure declares it <a href="#gui">cannot proceed without 
GUI_TOOLKIT</a>, or</li>
<li>you wish to <a href="#special">use a non-default compiler, or override
variables such as CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If these techniques are not adequate to solve your problems, you
may wish to:
<ul>
<li>compile a <a href="#batchOnly">batch only version of the lamarc converter</a>,</li>
<li>default to an <a href="#ancientConverter">ancient version of the lamarc converter</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="#selfEdit">edit the configure script and Makefile yourself</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4><a name="ostype">Setting LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE</a></h4>

<p>
While most of the lamarc code is not dependent on the user's operating system,
there are a few minor differences in I/O handling and standard library headers.
These differences require the setting of the variable <b>LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE</b>
so that appropriate code can be exercised for each operating system.
</p>
<p>
Under normal circumstances, the configure script should be able to
guess the correct value for LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE. If it cannot, you
may set the value by including an assignment to it when you
invoke the configure script.
For example
    <pre>
    ../configure LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE=LAMARC_COMPILE_MACOSX
    make
    </pre>
The assignment to LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE should come after any other arguments
to the configure script, for example:
    <pre>
    ../configure --enable-debug LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE=LAMARC_COMPILE_LINUX
    make
    </pre>
Legal values for LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE are:
<ul>
<li>LAMARC_COMPILE_LINUX</li>
<li>LAMARC_COMPILE_MACOSX</li>
<li>LAMARC_COMPILE_WINDOWS</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h4><a name="gui">Setting GUI_TOOLKIT</a></h4>

<p>
Under normal circumstances, the configure script should be able to
guess the correct value for GUI_TOOLKIT. If it cannot, or you wish
to use a different toolkit, you should set the value for GUI_TOOLKIT.
As with <a href="#ostype">setting LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE</a>, the assignment
is made at the end of the invocation of configure.
For example:
    <pre>
    ../configure GUI_TOOLKIT=gtk2
    make
    </pre>
The assignment to GUI_TOOLKIT should come after any other arguments
to the configure script, and is most likely to be needed when
you are also setting LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE. For example:
    <pre>
    ../configure --enable-debug LAMARC_CODE_OSTYPE=LAMARC_COMPILE_MACOSX GUI_TOOLKIT=mac
    make
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
Tested values for GUI_TOOLKIT are:
<ul>
<li>gtk2 -- tested on linux systems</li>
<li>mac -- tested on OS X systems</li>
<li>msw -- tested on a Windows system</li>
</ul>
It is possible that other toolkit values supported by wxWidgets work, 
including x11, Motif, and OS/2. If you wish to build for one of
these toolkits, we suggest you start with wxWidget's
<a href="http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Supported_Platforms">
information on supported platforms
(http://www.wxwidgets.org/docs/platform.htm)</a>.
</p>

<h4><a name="special">Specifying non-standard compiler and/or build flags</a></h4>

<p>
The configure script is designed to allow you to
specify a compiler or to pass options to the compiler
or preprocessor. For example, if you are testing out
a new C++ compiler you might invoke it like this:

    <pre>
    ../configure CXX=/path/to/my/compiler CXXFLAGS=&quot;I /path/to/my/include/files&quot;
    make
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
For more information on options and environment 
variables that effect the configure script type

    <pre>
    ../configure --help
    </pre>
</p>

<h4><a name="batchOnly">Compiling a batch only version of the converter</a></h4>

<p>
If you cannot successfully build for any GUI_TOOLKIT,
or if you wish to run the lamarc file converter as
part of a batch process, you can build a batch only
version of the converter with the following commands
(add CXX and CXXFLAGS, etc at the end if you need them):

    <pre>
    ../configure --disable-gui --enable-buildwx
    make
    </pre>
</p>

<h4><a name="ancientConverter">Compiling a wxWidgets-less converter</a></h4>

<p>
We recommend the following step only as a <b>last resort</b>.
If you are going to attempt it, we recommend that you
email us at
<A HREF="mailto:lamarc@u.washington.edu">lamarc@u.washington.edu</A>.
to make sure there isn't a better solution.
</p>

<p>
If you unable to build wxWidgets at all (and therefore not 
have access to the converter) you may instead configure and make as 
follows:

    <pre>
    ../configure --disable-converter
    make old_lam_conv
    make
    </pre>

You must explicitly give the argument to &quot;make old_lam_conv&quot; --
it will not otherwise be built.
Please be warned that <b>old_lam_conv</b> is <b>no longer maintained</b>
and will not have all features of the new converter.
</p>

<h4><a name="selfEdit">Editing the configure script and Makefile yourself</a></h4>

<p>
If none of the above techniques allows you to build the lamarc
programs, you have one further option -- edit the configure
script and Makefiles yourself.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to do this is to edit them the same way we do,
using autoconf and automake.
These tools are available at the following locations:
   <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/</a>
   <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/</a>
   </ul>
</p>

<p>
You may also wish to read additonal documentation
available at
</p>
   <ul>
   <li><a href="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/">http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/</a>
   <li><a href="http://seul.org/docs/autotut/">http://seul.org/docs/autotut/</a>
   </ul>

<p>
Make any edits you need to Makefile.am or configure.ac
and then issue the following series of commands
</p>

    <pre>
    aclocal
    autoconf
    autoheader
    automake --add-missing
    </pre>

<p>
You may then proceed to configure and make as in the section
<a href="#basic">Basic Instructions...</a> above.
</p>
