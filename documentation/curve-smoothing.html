<H2>Bayesian-LAMARC tutorial:  Curve smoothing</H2>

<h3>If I wanted to take the same data and smooth it myself, how would I
reproduce your results?</h3>

<P> After collecting a set of parameters (and Bayesian LAMARC will soon be
able to output 'summary files', which would contain this information), the
information is divvied into groups on a per-parameter and per-replicate
basis.  The data for each parameter is then smoothed using a Biweight 
kernel of the form:
</P>

<P><center>(15/16)(1-t<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> for abs(t) &lt; 1.0
</center></P>

<P> The width of this kernel is set as:</P>

<P><center>2.5 * &sigma; * n<sup>-1/5</sup>
</center></P>

<P>where n is the number of points in the data set, and &sigma; is the
smaller of the inter-quartile distance divided by 1.34, or the standard
deviation of the data set.  (If this value falls to zero or near-zero, we
substitute an arbitrary minimum to allow the program to continue).</P>

<P> After the data for one parameter from one replicate and one region are
smoothed, multi-replicate curves are created by averaging the individual
curves, while multi-region curves are created by multiplying and
re-normalizing the single-region curves.  (Multiple replicates are
different views of the same data, and are therefore averaged.  Multiple
regions are independent views using independent data, and are therefore
multiplied.)
</P>

<h3>Where did these numbers come from?</h3>

<P>The biweight kernel was chosen primarily because it is bounded and quick
to calculate.  A bounded kernel (unlike a Gaussian kernel) ensures that the
the resulting probability density curve has defined boundaries, which better
matches the priors for the parameters we estimate.  (An even better kernel
would be additionally constrained to not spread out over the bounds of the
prior, but this works for a basic attempt at analysis.)  Silverman (1986)
has demonstrated that the choice of kernels does not make an appreciable
difference in accuracy otherwise, so the biweight kernel was chosen over
other bounded kernels simply because it was simple to calculate.
</P>

<P>The formula for the kernel width was taken from Silverman (1986) as
modified for use for the biweight kernel.  The formula for figuring out the
optimal kernel weight (h<sub>opt</sub>) is:
</P>

<P>
<center>h<sub>opt</sub> = [&int;t<sup>2</sup>k(t)dt]<sup>-2/5</sup>
[&int;k(t)<sup>2</sup>dt]<sup>1/5</sup> [f"(x)dx]<sup>-1/5</sup>
n<sup>-1/5</sup>
</center>
</P>

<P>where k(t) is the kernel function, f(x) is the function you wish to
estimate, and n is the number of data points.  If a Gaussian is used as an
estimate of f(x), and the biweight kernel is used for k(t), this reduces
to:</P>

<P>
<center>h<sub>opt</sub> = [1/7]<sup>-2/5</sup> [5/7]<sup>1/5</sup> [3/8
&pi;<sup>-1/2</sup>&sigma;<sup>-5</sup>]<sup>-1/5</sup> n<sup>-1/5</sup>
</center>
</P>

<P>or</P>

<P>
<center>h<sub>opt</sub> = 2.78&sigma;n<sup>-1/5</sup></center>
</P>

<P>Silverman argues that you can account for the fact that your function is
unknown (instead of definitely Gaussian, as we assumed in the initial
calculation), by reducing the coefficient slightly (which is why we use 2.5
instead of 2.78), and use the lesser of the inter-quartile distance divided
by 1.34 and the standard deviation of the data for &sigma;.  Using both of
these substitutions, we arrive at the equation listed at the beginning:
</P>

<P><center>2.5 * &sigma; * n<sup>-1/5</sup>
</center></P>
