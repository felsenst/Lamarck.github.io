<H2>Using genotypic data</H2>

<P>The LAMARC program is not a tool to infer haplotypes in the sense
of telling you what the best haplotype resolutions would be.  However,
it can make estimates using genotypic data with unknown phase,
by including in its search space many different resolutions of the
haplotypes.</P>

<P>This process is not slow in itself, but it makes the search space
enormously larger, so you will need to run many more steps.  You will 
also almost surely need to use heating; otherwise the search tends to 
get "stuck" as soon as it finds a reasonably compatible tree and set 
of haplotypes.</P>

<P>If you can get haplotypes by family studies or experimental methods,
they will produce more accurate results than LAMARC's process.
However, if you can only get haplotypes by using some other form of
haplotype-inference software (such as the EM algorithm), it may be
better, if you have time, to use LAMARC's process instead (using the
inferred haplotypes as a starting point will speed up the search).  No
matter how good the haplotype-inference program, it will introduce
some bias by using only the "best" haplotypes; if these haplotypes
are not fully correct they will tend to indicate less recombination
than has actually occured. </P>

<H3>Input</H3>

<P>The XML format for phase-unknown data includes an extra tag within
each individual, &lt;phase&gt;.  This tag has an obligatory attribute
of "type" which can be either "known" or "unknown."  In the "known"
case, the phase tag encloses a list of all sites whose phase is
known (and therefore need not be reconsidered during the run).  In
the "unknown" case, the phase tag encloses a list of all sites
whose phase is not known (and therefore must be reconsidered).  Use
whichever is more convenient for your data.</P>

<P>If all sites are known, the phase tag can be omitted, or an empty
&lt;phase type="unknown"&gt; tag can be used.  If all sites are unknown,
an empty &lt;phase type="known"&gt; tag can be used.</P>

<P>Only one &lt;phase&gt; tag is allowed per individual.</P>

<P>You do not need to exclude sites which are homozygous, as they will
not be considered for phase inference anyway; but if any heterozygous
sites are phase-known, it is much better to indicate them as such
than to let them be unnecessarily reconsidered.</P>

<P>To indicate that a haplotype-reconsideration arrangement strategy 
should be used, add a &lt;haplotyping&gt; tag to the &lt;strategy&gt; section, 
and indicate for each strategy what proportion of the time it should 
be used.  For example, here is a valid strategy block that will spend 20%
of its effort on haplotype reconsideration and 80% on tree
reconsideration:</P>

<PRE>
 &lt;strategy&gt;
    &lt;resimulating&gt; 0.8 &lt;/resimulating&gt;
    &lt;haplotyping&gt; 0.2 &lt;/haplotyping&gt;
 &lt;/strategy&gt;
</PRE>

<P>We have used 20% haplotyping with fair success, but you may want
to experiment.  Note that the resimulating strategy is required;
100% effort on haplotyping is not a valid option.</P>

<H3>Menu</H3>

<P>To turn haplotype reconsideration on and off, use the Search Strategies
menu, Rearrangement submenu.  If haplotyping is off, selecting
its entry will turn it on, and you will be prompted for the 
frequency of haplotype reconsideration desired (for example, 0.2 
for 20% effort into reconsideration).  If haplotype reconsideration
is on, selecting its entry will turn it off.</P>

<P>Note that these options will have no effect unless some
phase-unknown sites are present in the data set.  Haplotype reconsideration
is automatically disabled for any region which lacks phase-unknown
sites.</P>

<H3>Search strategy </H3>

<P>Every step spent reconsidering the haplotypes is time not spent
reconsidering the tree.  So if you put 20% effort into haplotypes
you will need at least 20% more steps to get the same tree coverage.
It will probably be safer to double the number of steps so as to
allow for the increased search space.</P>

<P>Haplotype steps are quicker than tree-resimulation steps, so you
can afford to be fairly generous with the number of haplotype
steps.  However, we don't recommend putting more than 50% effort
into haplotype reconsideration, because this may end up optimizing 
the haplotypes of a very suboptimal tree.</P>

<P>Heating is almost essential for genotypic data unless
very few sites are phase-unknown.  Signs that the haplotype
sampler is "stuck" include estimates that don't move far from 
their starting value, or estimates that are nearly constant within 
one run but vary wildly between runs.
Stuck haplotyping runs normally overestimate Theta because they
are using sub-optimal haplotypes.  Unfortunately the error bars in
such cases may exclude the truth.</P>

<P>If you have access to a haplotype-inference program, using its
inferred haplotypes as a starting point may produce better estimates
more quickly.  We prefer this to simply accepting the externally
inferred haplotypes as correct.  While they may be nearly 
correct, they will err in a specific direction (corresponding to
a downward bias in Theta) because they are "too perfect" compared
to the truth.</P>

<H3> Evaluating the results </H3>

<P>When haplotype reconsideration is in effect, some extra information
will be printed in the runtime report and output report to let you
assess whether it is working well.  (The "runtime report" is the set of 
messages that Lamarc displays while it is running.  If you select
"verbose" output, these messages will be appended to your output file.)
Acceptance rates are given for
each type of "arranger" (rearrangement strategy) separately, so you might
see:</P>

<P><PRE>
Tree-Arranger accepted            149/1591 proposals
Haplotype-Arranger accepted       277/409 proposals
</PRE></P>

<P> This means that the resimulating arranger is not accepting very
many proposed trees, whereas the haplotype-reconsidering arranger is
accepting over half.  If one of the arrangers is accepting few or no
trees, your search is probably not working even if the overall acceptance
rate is satisfactory; at the very least, you will need to run the 
program for a long time to get adequate searching.</P>

<P> If multiple temperatures are in use, the reported acceptance
rates are for the coldest temperature only.</P>
