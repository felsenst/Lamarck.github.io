History of Lamarc -- the program
--------------------------------
2013
Nov 14        Lamarc-2.1.9:  This is a bug fix release
                   * FIXED MULTIPLE BUGS IN DIVERGENCE.  Results
                     from release 2.1.8 with divergence turned on
                     should be re-run.
                   * DIVERGENCE PRIORS can be set from menu
                   * INVARIANT LOCI no longer cause crashes as in 2.1.8

2012
May 29        Lamarc-2.1.8: This is a bug fix and new feature release
                   * FIXED BUG in MIGRATION
                   * FIXED BUG in negative GROWTH cases
                   * FASTER convergence in LIKELIHOOD cases
                   * NEW FEATURE -- panels
                   * NEW FEATURE -- divergence

2011
January 21    Lamarc-2.1.6: This is a bug fix release, with the
                   following changes:
                   * FIXED data likelihood bug that appears only
                     in cases with RECOMBINATION turned on. Results
                     obtained from releases 2.1.2 through 2.1.5
                     with the recombination force turned on should
                     be re-run.
                   * FIXED calculation of invariant data term for
                     SNP data modeled with a per-base error rate
                   * UPDATED random number generator to use the
                     Boost library, and added guards against 
                     returning values of exactly 0 or 1 for
                     double values

2009
December 21   Lamarc-2.1.5: This release includes a beta test version
                   of "data uncertainty", csv output formats for
                   curvefile and profile data (to make them easier
                   to read with R or Excel), and supplemental XML output
                   file "report.xml" to make it easier to automate
                   reading lamarc output.

2009
July 17       Lamarc-2.1.4: This release brings the code base up to
                   compilability with g++ 4.3.3. Additionally, minor user
                   experience bugs are fixed. This was used at the 
                   Woods Hole Molecular Evolution Conference but
                   not distributed via the Lamarc web site

2008
July 14       Lamarc-2.1.3: This release fixes a bug introduced into 
                   the code used to guess haplotype resolution. Analyses
                   using this feature in LAMARC versions 2.1.2 and 2.1.2b
                   should be re-run. Additional improvements include:
                    * Tracer output now renders step counts as integers
                      instead of reals.
                    * Mapping output now writable to its own file.
                    * Upgraded default wxWidgets installation to 2.8.8. 

2007
October 9     Lamarc-2.1.2b: Minor fixes to 2.1.2 affecting user
                   experience only

2007
October 4     Lamarc-2.1.2: Recombination now does not attempt to 
                   insert recombination events that have no effect on 
                   present-day data.
